# Buffer for Chrome

Repository for Buffer's [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/noojglkidnpfjbincgijbaiedldjfbhh?hl=en-GB)
and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/En-us/firefox/addon/buffer-for-firefox/) extensions.

This extension was built for Chrome, then tweaked to port it to the
[WebExtensions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions),
with which it's now virtually fully compatible.
